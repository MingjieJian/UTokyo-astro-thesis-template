# UTokyo-astro thesis template

This is the **unofficial** template for master thesis submitted Department of Astronomy, the University of Tokyo. It is adpoted from [ociamthesis](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/it/faqs/latex/thesis-class) by K.A. Gillow. The bibliography stype is adpoted from MNRAS template, with some small change in link color. 

This template can be also used for thesis of other department inside Graduace School of Science, by changing the `college` text.

The template is now still under development, and I am not sure if it fits the requirement of other department nor for a doctorial thesis.
